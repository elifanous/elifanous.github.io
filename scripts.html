            <p class="paragraph-text">A fun little game that I made in Python based on an already existing IRL game called "21". It's a two player game where Player 1 (you) types in either 1 or 2, which will then be added to the score. Then the bot goes, and he adds 1 or 2 to the score as well. The game goes back and forth like this until the score reaches 21 or over. Whoever adds the number that causes the score to reach 21 or over loses. For example, if the score is 20 and I add 1, then I would lose. Same would be true if I added 2. However, there is a twist on this version: the bot is on hard mode, meaning it will do its best to win at every presented oppurtunity. It's nothing too special, but it was fun to make and I hope you enjoy. (P.S - the game will be more enjoyable if you do not examine the code, at least not before playing it.)</p>

            <p class="paragraph-text">This is a script that I made using the Turtle bot extension. How it works is you put in how many sides your shape has, and the code will automatically draw an equilateral version of that shape. It's pretty simple, but I originally coded it in JavaScript, so sorry if the code looks a bit weird.</p>
